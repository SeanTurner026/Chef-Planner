Cooking best practice involves planning such that all of your dishes finish at the same time. This is great because your food will be warm, and you have some time for washing up in otherwise idle moments.

I used Python to do the necessary planning for me this. The yaml file provides the program with dishes, and for each dish, how long each step requires in minutes, and the description of each step. The program then figures out at what points in time each step should be done.
